## Key Insights 
  
   Correlation Summary
   Sales & Profit: Strong positive correlation → Higher sales lead to higher profits
   Quantity & Sales: Very weak correlation → More units sold ≠ More revenue
   Quantity & Profit: Very weak correlation → High volume may have low margins
   Insight: Focus on high-value products to increase profitability.

   This correlation shows the strength of relationships between Quantity, Sales, and Profit. There is a strong positive correlation between Sales and Profit, which means that as sales                increase, profit also increases. However, the correlation between Quantity and Sales, as well as Quantity and Profit, is very weak. This indicates that selling more units does not guarantee       higher revenue or profit — suggesting that some products may sell in high quantities but at low margins.
